Hi, I'm @Premudryi
I got involved with GitHub because I used HiJack This and am seeking help with it.
I believe I contacted GitHub years ago, using the E-mail address bandelinoj@yahoo.com, because I was interested in coding; but I was unable to complete my application at that time, and I don't remember the password I used, etc.
If the're's any way we can fix that, I'd like to use that address instead.
If this is a place to learn how to code, hey, I'm interested. I don't even know the basics, except that I've actually dared to help myself using Powershell. But I want to learn the ways of the coding force, so to speak, so I can make life easier for myself and others.
And if anyone knows how to help with Hijack This, please get in touch with me at bandelin@uw.edu. Again, bandelinoj@yahoo.com is another address of mine, and I would have preferred it; but GitHub wouldn't let me use that. Sorry for the confusion.
THANKS SO MUCH!
